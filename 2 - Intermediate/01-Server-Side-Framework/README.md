# 🚀 07 - Server Side Frameworks

## ✍️ What is a Server Side Framework

- A server side framework is like ***a toolkit that helps developers build the backend of web applications faster, cleaner, and more efficiently***. 
- Instead of writing everything from scratch, a framework provides pre-built components, standard architecture, and utilities to handle common backend tasks like routing, authentication, database interaction, and API responses.

***Think of a server side framework like using Lego blocks to build a house instead of carving each brick from stone.***

        <li>Instead of reinventing the wheel, developers focus on building features that matter most to the application.</li> </ul>

## ✍️ Best Server Side Frameworks in 2025

## _01. Spring Boot_

<p align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3c96a60-cb5a-4b75-b2a2-3a511d5f4c91" alt="Spring Boot Logo" width="300"/> </p>

Spring Boot is a battle-tested framework for building enterprise-level applications in Java. It simplifies the complex configuration of the traditional Spring framework, making backend development more streamlined and productive.

🟢 Why It Stands Out

- Ideal for creating robust, secure, and scalable enterprise systems

- Built-in tools for REST APIs, security, database handling, and microservices

- Widely adopted in industries like banking, telecom, and healthcare

- Offers seamless integration with tools like Hibernate, Kafka, and RabbitMQ

<br>

🟢 Best Fit For

- Enterprise-grade applications

- Projects requiring strong security, reliability, and scalability

- Java developers building large, modular systems
