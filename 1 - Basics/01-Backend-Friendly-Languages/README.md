## ✍️ What is Backend

The backend is the part of a website or application that we don't see. But it does all the heavy lifting, like processing data, managing database, authenticating users, handling business logic, serving content through APIs etc.

_**Backend is like the kitchen in a restaurant**_

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="40%" align="center">

    <td width="60%" align="left">
      <ul>
        <li>When we go to a restaurant and sit at a table, we look at the menu and place our order through a waiter. At that point, we are the user, and we interact with the menu and the waiter, which are the only parts we can actually see. This is the <strong>Frontend</strong>.</li></br>
        <li>After that, the order is sent to the restaurant’s kitchen, where the chef prepares it using ingredients and follows specific steps. But we don’t see what happens in the kitchen. We don’t know exactly what they used or how the process worked. That hidden part is the <strong>Backend</strong>.</li></br>
        <li>Once the food is ready, the chef hands it back to the waiter, who brings it to our table, just like how the backend sends the final result back to the frontend for the user to see.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>

## ✍️ What Makes Up the Backend

The backend is mainly built on **three core components**:

- **Server** – The machine (physical or cloud) where our backend code runs.
- **Application** – The logic written using a backend language that handles the rules, requests, and responses.
- **Database** – Where all the app’s data is stored, retrieved, or modified.
  
Together, these work behind the scenes to power everything a user does on the frontend.
