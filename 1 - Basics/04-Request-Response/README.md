#  Requests & Responses 

âœ… 2. Request & Response Headers
Headers carry metadata about the request/response. Examples:

## Request Headers:
User-Agent: Info about the browser or device

Accept: What kind of content is expected (HTML, JSON, etc.)

Authorization: Contains tokens or login credentials




## Response Headers:
Content-Type: The format of the response (e.g., text/html, application/json)

Set-Cookie: Stores data in the browser

Cache-Control: Tells the browser how to cache the response

ðŸ”¹ Helpful to explain that not all communication is in the visible body â€” headers matter too.
