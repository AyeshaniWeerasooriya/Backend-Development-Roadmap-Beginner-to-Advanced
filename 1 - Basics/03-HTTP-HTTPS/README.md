# HTTP/HTTPS Requests


🌐 What Does HTTP Mean?
HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.

It is the foundation of communication on the web — a set of rules used by web browsers and servers to send and receive data.


🧭 In Simple Terms:
When you open a website like http://example.com:

Your browser sends an HTTP request to the server asking for the page.

The server sends back an HTTP response with the content (like HTML, images, text).



📦 What an HTTP Request Contains:
URL – The web address you want to access

Method – Such as GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE

Headers – Extra info like browser type, content type, etc.

Body (optional) – Only in some methods like POST (contains data to send)


⚠️ Important:
HTTP is not secure.

Data sent through HTTP is not encrypted.

Anyone can intercept or modify the data (like passwords or personal info).
