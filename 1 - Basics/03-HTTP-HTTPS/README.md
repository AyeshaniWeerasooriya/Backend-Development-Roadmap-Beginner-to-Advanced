# üöÄ HTTP & HTTPS Requests

## ‚úçÔ∏è What is HTTP and HTTPS

HTTP stands for **HyperText Transfer Protocol**

- This protocol used to structure and transfer data across the web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between clients (like web browsers) and servers.

HTTPS stands for **HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure**

- It performs the same role as HTTP but adds a layer of security through SSL/TLS encryption, protecting sensitive data from being read or altered during transmission.

## ‚úçÔ∏è How HTTP Works

Imagine visiting a website like `www.udemy.com`. On the surface, it looks like a simple action. But in behind, several important steps are happening.

### 1. Typing the URL
- A user enters `www.udemy.com` in the browser‚Äôs address bar.

### 2. Choosing the Protocol
- The browser detects that the site supports HTTPS and adds it in the background.
