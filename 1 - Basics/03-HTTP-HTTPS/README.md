# HTTP/HTTPS Requests


🌐 What Does HTTP Mean?
HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.

It is the foundation of communication on the web — a set of rules used by web browsers and servers to send and receive data.


🧭 In Simple Terms:
When you open a website like http://example.com:

Your browser sends an HTTP request to the server asking for the page.

The server sends back an HTTP response with the content (like HTML, images, text).
