#  ðŸš€ Version Control with Git & GitHub

## What is Version Control 

Version control is a system that helps keep track of changes made to code over time. It allows developers to manage the history of their code, return to previous versions if needed, and work on projects with others without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.

When working on a project or document, itâ€™s common to save different versions manually to avoid losing progress or to try out new ideas. This often results in files like:
- `project_v1.docx`
- `project_final.docx`
- `project_final2.docx`
- `project_final_final_revised.docx`
  
Each file holds a slightly different version of the same project. Over time, it becomes difficult to remember which file is the latest version, what changes were made in each file, who made which change, especially in team projects. This method is not only confusing but also risky. Because important updates might be lost or overwritten. 

**Version control** solves this by storing every change in one organized system, showing what changed, when it changed, and who made the change.
