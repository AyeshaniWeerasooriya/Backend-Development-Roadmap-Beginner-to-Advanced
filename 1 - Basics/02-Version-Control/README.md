Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code over time. It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each otherâ€™s work. Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git is now the most widely used version control system in software development.


 Key Features of Git:
Version Control: Keeps a history of changes made to files, enabling you to revert to previous versions if needed.

Distributed System: Every developer has a complete copy of the code repository, which ensures fast operations and offline access.

Branching & Merging: Allows you to work on new features or bug fixes in isolated branches, and then merge them into the main codebase when ready.

Collaboration: Supports team collaboration through platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.


##  Common Git Commands:
git init: Initializes a new Git repository.

git clone: Makes a copy of a remote repository.

git add: Stages changes to be committed.

git commit: Saves changes to the local repository.

git push: Uploads local commits to a remote repository.

git pull: Downloads updates from a remote repository.

git status: Shows the status of changes in the working directory.
