#  üöÄ Version Control with Git & GitHub

## ‚úçÔ∏è What is Version Control 

Version control is a system that helps keep track of changes made to code over time. It allows developers to manage the history of their code, return to previous versions if needed, and work on projects with others without overwriting each other‚Äôs work.

When working on a project or document, it‚Äôs common to save different versions manually to avoid losing progress or to try out new ideas. This often results in files like:
- `project_v1.docx`
- `project_final.docx`
- `project_final2.docx`
- `project_final_final_revised.docx`

Each file holds a slightly different version of the same project. Over time, it becomes difficult to remember which file is the latest version, what changes were made in each file, who made which change, especially in team projects. This method is not only confusing but also risky. Because important updates might be lost or overwritten. 

**Version control** solves this by storing every change in one organized system, showing what changed, when it changed, and who made the change.

‚úçÔ∏è What Are the Version Control Systems Available?
Version Control Systems (VCS) come in many forms, each designed to help manage and track changes in software projects. Here are some of the most popular and widely used version control systems:

üîß 1. Git
The most popular and widely used distributed version control system.

Developed by Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux).

Used with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

Supports offline work, powerful branching, and collaboration.

üîß 2. Subversion (SVN)
A centralized version control system developed by the Apache Software Foundation.

Simple to use and good for teams that prefer centralized control.

Often used in enterprise or legacy systems.

üîß 3. Mercurial
A distributed version control system like Git.

Known for simplicity and performance.

Less popular than Git but still used in some open-source and enterprise projects.

üîß 4. Perforce (Helix Core)
A high-performance VCS designed for large-scale enterprise projects.

Often used in game development, digital media, and large codebases.

Centralized and powerful, with strong support for binary files.
