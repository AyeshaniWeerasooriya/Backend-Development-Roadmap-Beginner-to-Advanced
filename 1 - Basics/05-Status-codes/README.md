# 🚀 05 - HTTP Status Codes

## ✍️ What is a Status Code?

Every time a server responds to a client’s request, it sends back a status code — a 3-digit number — that tells the client what happened with the request.
It’s part of the status line in an HTTP response.

## ✍️ Why Status Codes Matter

- Help developers debug requests and responses

- Let the client know what to expect (success, error, redirect, etc.)

- Critical for frontend-backend coordination and API development

- Used in tools like Postman, browser dev tools, and backend logs
