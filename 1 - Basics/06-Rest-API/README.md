# 🚀 06 – REST APIs

## ✍️ What is a REST API?

A **REST API** (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) allows different systems — like your frontend and backend — to communicate with each other over the internet using HTTP.

Think of it like a **messenger**:  
The client (like a browser or app) sends a request to the server, and the server responds with data.

> 💡 If HTTP is the language, REST is the grammar that defines how systems should communicate.
