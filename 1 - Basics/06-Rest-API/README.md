✍️ What is a REST API

A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) enables two systems to communicate over HTTP. One system, such as a frontend application, sends a request, and the backend server provides the appropriate response. This communication pattern is foundational to modern web and mobile apps.

✍️ API in a Real-World Analogy

Consider a restaurant:

A customer places an order (request) through a waiter.

The waiter delivers the order to the kitchen (server).

The kitchen prepares the food and gives it to the waiter.

The waiter returns with the dish (response).

In this analogy:

The client is the customer.

The API is the waiter.

The server is the kitchen.








✍️ REST Principles

REST follows specific principles:

Principle

Description

Client-Server

Separation of user interface and data storage

Stateless

Each request is independent and contains all required information

Cacheable

Responses can be stored by clients to improve performance

Uniform Interface

A consistent structure for requests and responses

Layered System

Intermediary servers can improve scalability and security

Code on Demand

Optional: server can send executable code
