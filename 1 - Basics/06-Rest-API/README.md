## ‚úçÔ∏è REST Principles (Key Concepts)

<table> 
  <tr> 
    <td><b>Principle</b></td> 
    <td><b>Description</b></td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td>Stateless</td> 
    <td>Each request from client to server must contain all information. The server does not remember previous requests.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td>Client-Server</td> 
    <td>Frontend and backend are separated, so they can evolve independently.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td>Uniform Interface</td> 
    <td>Resources (data) are identified with URIs like <code>/users</code> or <code>/products/5</code>.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td>Cacheable</td> 
    <td>Responses can be cached to improve performance.</td> 
  </tr>
