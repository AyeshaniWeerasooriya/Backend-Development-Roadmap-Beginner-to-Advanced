A REST API, or Representational State Transfer API, is a way for different software systems to communicate with each other over the internet


Here’s the historical timeline of REST APIs:

Before REST: Developers used SOAP to integrate APIs by handwriting an XML document with a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in the body. Then, developers would specify the endpoint and POST their SOAP envelope to that endpoint.
2000: A group of developers, including Roy Fielding, decided to create a standard so any one server can talk to any other server. He defined the constraints for REST APIs. Since these rules are universal, it is simpler for developers to integrate necessary software.
2002: In 2002, eBay built its REST API, expanding its market to any site that could access its API. As a result, it caught the attention of Amazon, another e-commerce giant, who announced their API in 2002.
2004-2006: In 2004, Flickr then launched their RESTful API, enabling bloggers to easily embed images onto their sites as well as their social media feeds. Then, Facebook and Twitter both released their APIs two years later when they realized a large number of developers were scraping the sites and creating “Frankenstein” APIs.
2006-Now: Today, developers have embraced RESTful APIs fully – using them to add functionality within their websites and applications. Postman simplifies the process of building an API and streamlines collaboration so you can create APIs faster.
